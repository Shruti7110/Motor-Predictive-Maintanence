# Motor-Predictive-Maintanence

# Predictive Maintenance with Machine Learning
A machine learning model to detect motor anomalies using real-time accelerometer and gyroscope data.

# Deploying the file
Add your data collected when motor is in ideal state and during abnormal conditions to the ML_Model_train.py file. it is train and genertae a cpp file of the model to add to the arduino repository
- You can use sample data provided to try out the code.
